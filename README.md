# Task Management Application (SOLID Principles with Express.js and MongoDB)

This is a **Task Management Application** built using **Express.js** and **MongoDB** that demonstrates the use of **SOLID principles** to create a maintainable, scalable, and flexible codebase. The application allows users to create, update, view, and delete tasks. It adheres to the **SOLID design principles** to ensure clean code architecture and high maintainability.

## Features

- **Create tasks** with a title, description, and completed status.
- **Read tasks** by fetching all tasks or by a specific task ID.
- **Update tasks** by modifying the title, description, and completion status.
- **Delete tasks** from the database.
- Built with **SOLID principles** to ensure code maintainability, scalability, and flexibility.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed:

- **Node.js** (v14.x or later)
- **MongoDB** running locally or use a MongoDB cloud instance (e.g., MongoDB Atlas)

## Installation

Follow these steps to set up the project locally.

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/seliesh20/node-solid-example.git
   cd node-solid-example
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set up MongoDB**:
   - Ensure MongoDB is running locally or use a MongoDB cloud service like [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas).
   - The default connection string is `mongodb://localhost:27017/node-solid-example`. If using Atlas or another MongoDB service, update the connection string in `index.js`.

## Usage

1. Start the server by running:

   - For **production**:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   - For **development** (with **nodemon** to automatically restart the server on file changes):

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. Open your browser or Postman to interact with the API at `http://localhost:3000`.

### Example: Create a New Task

You can create a new task by sending a `POST` request to `/api/tasks` with the following JSON body:

```json
{
  "title": "Complete SOLID Task App",
  "description": "Build a task management app following SOLID principles",
  "completed": false
}
```

### Example: Get All Tasks

To get a list of all tasks, send a `GET` request to `/api/tasks`.

### Example: Get a Specific Task

To get a specific task by ID, send a `GET` request to `/api/tasks/{taskId}`.

### Example: Update a Task

To update a task, send a `PUT` request to `/api/tasks/{taskId}` with the updated data in the body:

```json
{
  "title": "Complete SOLID Task App (Updated)",
  "description": "Make necessary updates and improvements",
  "completed": true
}
```

### Example: Delete a Task

To delete a task, send a `DELETE` request to `/api/tasks/{taskId}`.

## API Endpoints

| Method  | Endpoint         | Description                                         |
| ------- | ---------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| `GET`   | `/api/tasks`     | Get all tasks                                       |
| `GET`   | `/api/tasks/:id` | Get a specific task by ID                          |
| `POST`  | `/api/tasks`     | Create a new task                                  |
| `PUT`   | `/api/tasks/:id` | Update a task by ID                                |
| `DELETE`| `/api/tasks/:id` | Delete a task by ID                                |

## SOLID Principles Applied

The application follows **SOLID principles** to ensure that the code is well-structured, maintainable, and scalable.

1. **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**: 
   - Each class has one responsibility: `TaskController` handles HTTP requests, `TaskService` handles business logic, and `TaskRepository` interacts with MongoDB.
   
2. **Open/Closed Principle (OCP)**: 
   - The `TaskService` class is open for extension (adding new features) but closed for modification. You can add new methods without changing existing code.

3. **Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)**: 
   - The `TaskService` works with any `TaskRepository` implementation, so you can easily swap the data layer (e.g., for testing purposes or changing the database) without breaking the code.

4. **Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)**: 
   - The `TaskRepository` exposes only the necessary methods, keeping interfaces minimal and focused.

5. **Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)**: 
   - The `TaskService` depends on the `TaskRepository` abstraction, not on the concrete database implementation, allowing for flexibility and easier testing.
